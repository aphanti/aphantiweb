<h1>Terms of Service <small>(adapted from <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>)</small></h1> 

<p>These Terms govern your access to and use of AphantI.com.</p>

<p>Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that may be published from time to time by AphantI (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades.</p>

<p>Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.</p>

<h2>1. Who’s Who</h2>

<p>Throughout these Terms, “you” applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.</p>

<p>We refer to AphantI collectively as “AphantI” or “we” throughout these Terms.</p>

<h2>2. Your Account</h2>

<p>Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.</p>

<p>You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.</p>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>

<p>When you create a AphantI.com account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it’s an email, phone call, or text message.</p>

<h2>3. Minimum Age Requirements</h2>

<p>Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (or 16 years or older in the European Union).</p>

<h2>4. Responsibility of Visitors and Users</h2>
<p>We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (“Content”) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.</li>
    <li>If you post Content, comment on a website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) Content available on our Services, you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.</li>
    <li>We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase, or downloading of Content. If you access or use any Content, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.</li>
    <li>Any Content offered for sale through any of our Services are the seller’s sole responsibility, and you agree that you will look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Content.</li>
    <li>We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.</li>
    <li>Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Content.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, AphantI.com or our other Services. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use.</li>
    <li>The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.</li>
    <li>We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-AphantI websites.</li>

<h2>6. Specific Service Terms</h2>

<h3>a. AphantI.com Websites and Accounts</h3>

<p>AphantI.com enables you to create beautiful blogs, and we would love for you to use it. </p>

<p>AphantI.com’s basic service is free. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on your blog as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. You own all content you post to your website. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear on your blogs.</p>

<p>If you find a AphantI.com website that you believe violates these Terms, please email admin@aphanti.com to report it.</p>

<p><strong>Removing Content.</strong> If you delete Content, we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view on AphantI.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> By using AphantI.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate the following:</p>

<div class='container' style="margin-left: 30px;">
    <h4>User Guidelines</h5>
    <p>AphantI.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them. That being said, there are a few categories of content and behavior that we don’t permit because we consider them harmful to the community.</p>
    <p>To be transparent about what is and isn’t allowed on your site, we’ve put together this set of guidelines. The following activity/material isn’t allowed on AphantI.com.</p>

    <hr>
    <h5>Illegal content and conduct.</h5>
    <p>Self-explanatory.</p>

    <h5>Intellectual property infringement.</h5>
    <p>AphantI.com is a publishing, rather than a file sharing platform, so we recognize that copyrighted materials are often used in <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">fair use</a> context. We strongly support this and urge copyright holders to take this into consideration before submitting complaints. If you’re not sure, the golden rule is to always ask the rights holder for permission before republishing their content.</p>

    <h5>Pornography.</h5>
    <p>We know that there may be different definitions of this, but generally, we define pornography as visual depictions of sexually explicit acts. </p>

    <h5>Gambling.</h5>
    <p>Discussing gambling on your site isn’t a problem. What about operating an online gambling service (including poker)? No dice. Please also be aware that if your site is primarily designed to link to other gambling sites, we consider this spam, and a breach of the user guidelines.</p>

    <h5>Technologically harmful content.</h5>
    <p>Please don’t upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.</p>

    <h5>Impersonation.</h5>
    <p>Don’t claim to be a person or organization you’re not. (Parody and satire are ok though!)</p>

    <h5>Calls to violence.</h5>
    <p>Do not publish realistic calls to violence. By that we mean that you cannot post content which threatens, incites, or promotes violence, physical harm, or death. This includes threats targeting individuals or groups, as well as other indiscriminate acts of violence. This restriction does not mean that we will remove hyperbolic or generally offensive language.</p>

    <h5>Posting private information.</h5>
    <p>Don’t share someone’s personal information without their consent. This includes collecting sensitive information such as account passwords and credit card numbers, to name a couple.</p>

    <h5>Advertising.</h5>
    <p>Advertising isn’t permitted.</p>

    <h5>Spam or machine-generated content.</h5>
    <p>You know what this is, but in general, sites such as those primarily dedicated to drive traffic to third party sites, boost SEO, phish, spoof, or promote affiliate marketing aren’t cool. We don’t want you to pollute the web outside of AphantI.com either, so we ask you to please avoid sending unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails about your site, even if it’s not on AphantI.com.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Bear in mind that these are just guidelines — <strong>interpretations are solely up to us</strong>. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> We reserve the right to display advertisements on your blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution.</strong> We reserve the right to display attribution text or links in your website footer or toolbar, attributing AphantI.com or the theme author, for example. Some of these attributions may not be altered or removed.</p>

<h2>7. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>

<p>As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with an AphantI product or service violates your copyright, please notify us. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of AphantI or others.</p>

<h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>The Agreement does not transfer from AphantI to you any AphantI or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with AphantI. AphantI, AphantI, AphantI.com, the AphantI.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with AphantI.com or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of AphantI or AphantI’s licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any AphantI or third party trademarks.</p>

<h2>9. Third Party Services</h2>

<p>In using the Services, you may enable or use services, products, software (like themes or plugins), embeds, or applications developed by a third party or yourself (“Third Party Services”) on your blog.</p>


<p>If you use any Third Party Services, you understand that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Third Party Services are not vetted, endorsed, or controlled by AphantI.</li>
    <li>Any use of a Third Party Service is at your own risk, and we shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for Third Party Services.</li>
    <li>Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and will be governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review the Third Party’s terms and policies before using a Third Party Service.</li>
    <li>Some Third Party Services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data, for example, via a pixel or cookie. If you use the Third Party Service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices. We do not have control over how a Third Party Service may use your data. You should carefully review Third Party Services’ data collection, retention, and use policies and practices before enabling Third Party Services.</li>
    <li>Third Party Services may not work appropriately with your blog, and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by any Third Party Services.</li>
    <li>If you have questions or concerns about how a Third Party Service operates, or need support, please contact the Third Party directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>In rare cases, we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third Party Services from your account or website.</p>

<h2>10. Changes</h2>

<p>We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of AphantI, or by the posting by AphantI of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>

<h2>11. Termination</h2>

<p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any AphantI policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict the resources your website uses, or terminate your Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth usage is out of hand and burdens our systems, or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason.</p>

<p>If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your AphantI.com account, you may simply discontinue using our Services.</p>

<p>All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
